# magloop_pico

This is a derivative of the Magnetic Loop Controller based on the STM32 "Blue Pill" microcontroller.
This derivative uses the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

The firmware was developed using Visual Studio Code and the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK.
It is not compatible with the Arduino IDE, although a future fork to Arduino may be possible in the
future.
